SKILLS 
PROJECTS ● Pothole Detection Using OpenCV. 
In this Project, I use the Yolo V4 model to analyse the road condition to ﬁnd the pothole. 
And made my own data set to train the model. 
● Bangla HandWriting Detection Sorborno Using OpenCV 
In this Project, I trained a model with a custom data set and this Model will detect which 
Bangla Handwriting are drawn. 
● Human Movement analysis Using LSTM. 
This project used Mediapipe to pose estimation and LSTM  neural network architecture for 
Human Movement analysis. In the Human Movement analysis training, I got 74% 
precision. 
● Machine Learning-Optimized Metamaterial Sensor for Real-Time Insoluble 
Particle Position Monitoring in Multiphase Oil Flow. 
A newly devised sensor, featuring four split-ring resonators on a Rogers RT5880 
substrate, detects changes in dielectric properties of ﬂowing liquids like palm oil and 
water. With Machine learning validation, achieving 94.27% accuracy ensures dependable 
performance in varying environments. 
● Human Face detection with Position and Familiar face Identiﬁcation. 
● Human Emotion Detection and Face Expression analysis. 
● Stair Detection using Yolo With Custom Dataset. 
● Obstacle Avoiding Autonomous Car. 
In this project, we use an ultrasonic sensor to detect the object. We use Arduino Uno 
which is an ATmega328 IC-based microcontroller board. If this robot ﬁnds an object in its 
path, it will ﬁnd another path to move forward. ● Sumo bot ( Autonomous Fighting Bot ). 
This robot is a fully autonomous Fighting bot .It's a updated version of our ﬁrst project 
which can make his decision itself .To ﬁnd the opponent we use two type of sensor one 
is ultrasonic sensor another one is Infrared sensor. 
● Fighting Robot 
It's a Fully Human control Fighting Robot.We(X-treme) Used a 2.4G 6CH RC Transmitter 
With an FS-iA6B Receiver to control this. As a Microcontroller we used Arduino Mega 
2560 which has a ATmega2560 IC. 
● Semi-Autonomous GPS Based Drone 
In this Project, we used an Arducopter APM Flight Controller with Ublox NEO GPS with 
a compass to better control and track the drone's position. 
● Self-Balancing Drone. 
Arduino-based Human control drone that can balance itself. For control, we use an 
FS-CT6B Radio controller and an MPU6050 module used for self-balancing. 
● Plotter pen cnc machine using arduino uno. 
CNC plotting machine to create a 2D image on plain paper. Depending on the image to 
be drawn, the Computer will generate the appropriate coordinates and send them to the 
microcontroller through the USB port. The microcontroller interprets these coordinates 
and then controls the positions of the motors and pen to create the image.

This study presents a framework for outdoor visual analysis and navigation. It uses 
YOLO-V4 for object detection, Mediapipe for pose estimation, LSTM for human 
movement analysis, and Deep Face for emotion analysis. The system also employs 
color detection for traﬃc lights, Haarcascade and KNN for face detection, and 
ultrasonic sensor with servo motors for distance measuring. Testing achieved 84.83%

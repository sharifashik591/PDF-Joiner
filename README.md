# üìÑ Resume Evaluation Project

Welcome to the Resume Evaluation Project! This project evaluates resumes against a job description (JD) PDF to generate scores based on their relevance.

## Abstract

The Resume Evaluation Project automates the initial screening of job applicants by assessing the relevance of resumes to a given job description (JD) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilizes PDF text extraction, text preprocessing, and similarity comparison methods to quantify how closely each applicant's qualifications align with the job requirements outlined in the JD. By generating scores or rankings based on these comparisons, the system aims to expedite the hiring process, ensuring that candidates most closely matching the job criteria receive priority consideration. This project enhances efficiency in candidate evaluation, providing a systematic and data-driven approach to streamline hiring decisions.



## üîÑ Flow

1. **Extract Text from PDFs (`extract_text.py`)**:
   - Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text from both the job description and resume PDFs.
   - Cleans and preprocesses the extracted text data.

2. **Preprocess Text Data (`preprocess.py`)**:
   - Cleans and preprocesses the extracted text data (e.g., remove special characters, lowercase, tokenize).

3. **Compare Text Similarity (`compare.py`)**:
   - Uses text similarity metrics (e.g., TF-IDF, cosine similarity) to compare preprocessed resume texts with the preprocessed JD text.

4. **Evaluate Resumes Against JD (`evaluate.py`)**:
   - Generates scores or rankings based on the similarity metrics.

5. **Utilities (`utils.py`)**:
   - Includes utility functions used across scripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/resume_evaluation_project.git
   cd resume_evaluation_project
    pip install -r requirements.txt


‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Prepare your files:

Ensure data/job_description.pdf contains your job description.
Place resume PDFs in data/resumes/ folder.
Run the main script to evaluate resumes: python src/main.py

# Future Directions
Looking ahead, the evolution of this project could lead to several advancements and enhancements:

1. Enhanced Accuracy: Further refinement of NLP models and algorithms to improve the accuracy of resume-JD matching.

2. Integration of AI: Exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning to adaptively learn from past evaluations and improve predictive capabilities.

3. Scalability: Designing the system to handle larger volumes of resumes and diverse job descriptions without compromising performance.

4. User Interface (UI) Enhancements: Development of a user-friendly interface for recruiters to easily visualize and interpret evaluation results.

5. Ethical Considerations: Addressing ethical implications related to bias detection and ensuring fairness in automated decision-making processes.

The future of projects like the Resume Evaluation Project lies in continual innovation and adaptation to meet evolving recruitment needs. By leveraging advancements in technology and data science, these systems have the potential to revolutionize the hiring process, making it more efficient, transparent, and inclusive.
